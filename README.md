## Electric Vehicle Sales Drop

### Problem Statement:

Zoom Electric (ZE) is an electric vehicle venture owned by a renowned automotive manufacturer called ZOOM MOTORS India Private Limited.

Recently, ZE has introduced a new scooter variant, Sprint in the 2-wheeler EV scooter segment. Initially, Sprint Scooters' sales numbers were quite impressive in the first two weeks of launch but suddenly it started decreasing unexpectedly.

As a data analyst in the **Sales and Operations** team, my task is to validate the sales drop for Sprint scooters and figure out the reasons for this decline.
